		<p>The project portfolio for OTS includes the current active projects:</p>

<h2 id="child-welfare-system---new-system-cws-ns">Child Welfare System - New System (CWS-NS)</h2>
<p>OTS is providing system architecture, project management, and procurement assistance to this project that is the collaboration between California Department of Social Services (CDSS) and the Office of Systems Integration. The CWS-NS project is a showcase for agile development in the state, and is arguably the largest government project in the country to exclusively use the agile (scrum) methodology.</p>

<h2 id="calstrs">CalSTRS</h2>
<p>Business analysis and testing resources are currently onsite at CalSTRS assisting in the huge effort to modernize CalSTRS pension (and numerous associated) systems.</p>

<h2 id="calheers">CalHEERS</h2>
<p>The CalHEERS project is moving out of active development and into maintenance. This huge and highly visible state project is utilizing OTS resources to assist with the procurement strategy needed to make this transition as numerous contracts are being re-procured and replaced.</p>

<p>Other state project and departments that OTS has worked with:</p>

<h2 id="state-of-calilfornia-employment-development-department--unemployment-insurance">State of Calilfornia, Employment Development Department – Unemployment Insurance</h2>
<p>Currently providing System Engineering and System Architectural Guidance to the EDD. This $70M project includes implementing a SOA-based application that provides a common infrastructure to both an IVR and Internet-based suite of applications. OTS has assisted in the procurement process through the successful signing of vendors for both (call center and legacy modernization) sub projects, as well as assisted in the implementation. The call center portion of the project is scheduled to go live in June of 2010. This call center will utilize a custom built IVR built on the Microsoft .NET/WCF platform, and will seamlessly work with a Verizon hosted, Genesys-based Hosted Intelligent Call Routing Engine (HICR) system.</p>

<h2 id="state-of-california-employment-development-department--disability-insurance">State of California, Employment Development Department – Disability Insurance</h2>
<p>OTS worked as a sub-contractor on the $50M DIA project, leading the requirements development effort and providing expertise in the development of the DIA RFP. The RFP was successfully released, and a vendor chosen and signed in January of 2010.</p>

<h2 id="innovate-motorsports">Innovate Motorsports</h2>
<p>OTS provided project management and technical expertise to build a customer facing e-commerce system (www.innovatemotorsports.com) from the ground up. This project, hosted at Rackspace on a dedicated server, included a shopping cart that integrated with a manufacturing and order processing system through an internet based interface. The site has been processing over $1M/yr in orders with no security breaches and no unplanned downtime.</p>
