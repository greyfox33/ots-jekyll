You've started your project, but you could use some help.

You are short skilled staff, you are already behind schedule, and another project is arguing that your budget would be best used on their project. In short, you are not having much fun.

OTS can provide skilled technical resources, and PMs to help manage your project. We can also help
with your project strategy, helping you to avoid the budget and political problems that often derail projects.

OTS can help you get on track, stay on track...and hopefully laugh a little along the way.

OTS has been in business for over 10 years. We excel at:

- State Government application development projects
- Technical Project Management (agile and waterfall)
- IT strategy
- IT architecture (enterprise, system, and application)
